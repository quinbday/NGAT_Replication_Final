This is a github repository based on [the original NGAT repository](https://github.com/FreddieNIU/NGAT) which has several fixes assisted by Copilot and ChatGPT to fill missing files and data from the original repository that is missing from the code, however this is already run and contains all files needed including the file for the trained model. Below is the description written by one of the authors in the original GitHub file.

The original paper is [NGAT: A Node-level Graph Attention Network
for Long-term Stock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02018), their GitHub repository is located [here](https://github.com/FreddieNIU/NGAT/tree/main).

The two data sets, [ACL2018](https://github.com/yumoxu/stocknet-dataset) (2014-2016) and [SPNews](https://github.com/FreddieNIU/Financial-Graph-Evaluation/tree/main) (2022-2024) originally were for [Stock Movement Prediction from Tweets and Historical Prices](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1183/) and [Evaluating Financial Relational Graphs: Interpretation Before Prediction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3677052.3698644) respectively.


I am unsure if the model is local or not. If it is not on your computer, please run main.py, predict.py, main_classification.py, data_interpreter.ipynb, and output_review.ipynb to obtain all necessary files and setups to run Final_Report.ipynb.

If the model is not local, it need to be trained for standard deviation for both data sets through main_classification.py for the full analysis in Final_Project.ipynb to work. New Data Generation is new data for all 88 companies in ACL2018 until 02/06/2026 to attempt to apply either ACL2018 or SPNews to the data to predict it, although it also needs to be trained since my computer has low memory.
